# Shoot Around

This is the first app I ever submitted to the App Store. I was 13 at the time, and had been teaching myself iOS development for only a few months prior to starting this project. It's pretty much filled with horrible things you should never do (the entire app takes place in a single view controller, for one), but it compiled and worked, and back then that's all I cared about ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

Technically it's [still in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shoot-around/id333195242?mt=8), but only for nostalgic reasons. Unfortunately, by linking with the latest SDK, the app has far more bugs than the current version in the App Store, but hey it's still cool that it compiles after all this time (this was back when iOS 3.0 was released)!

Anyway, enjoy the code, and learn what not to do!
